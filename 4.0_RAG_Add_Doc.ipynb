Fabric unified administration enables you to secure and govern data across the\\nplatform, and manage Fabric features. Controlling feature access and capabilities allow you to\\ncomply with company policies and external rules and regulations. Fabric also allows admins to\\ndelegate their responsibilities. Delegation lets you create different groups of admins for\\ndifferent tasks in your organization. Delegating admin responsibilities can reduce pressure that\\nmight cause one admin team to become a bottleneck for organizational processes.\\nThis article uses the generic term \"admin.\" For details about which types of admins can perform\\nthe tasks described here, visit these articles:\\nAdmin roles in Fabric.\\nMicrosoft Entra built-in roles\\nMicrosoft 365 admin roles\\nAs an admin, you can manage many platform aspects for your organization. This section\\ndiscusses the ability to manage some of Fabric\\'s components, and the impact this has on your\\norganization.\\nTo access the Fabric SaaS platform, you need a license. Fabric has two type of licenses:\\nCapacity license - An organizational license that provides a pool of resources for Fabric\\noperations. Capacity licenses are divided into stock keeping units (SKUs). Each SKU\\nprovides a different number of capacity units (CUs) which are used to calculate the\\ncapacity\\'s compute power.\\nPer user license - Per user licenses allow users to work in Fabric.\\nTo purchase licenses, you must be a Billing administrator. Billing administrators can buy\\nlicenses and control them with tools such as capacity pause and resume and scale.\\nAfter you purchase licenses, use the Microsoft 365 admin center, PowerShell, or the Azure\\nportal to view and manage those licenses.\\nManage\\nGrant and manage licenses'),\n",

Perhaps all\\nlicensing is centralized and managed by an admin team or perhaps your organization doesn't\\npermit trials. To learn how to turn off self-service, visit Enable or disable self-service.\\nTurning off self-service sign-up keeps users from exploring Fabric on their own. If you block\\nindividual sign-up, you might want to get Fabric (free) licenses for your organization and assign\\nthem to all users.\\nAs an admin, you can't assign or unassign licenses for a self-service purchase subscription\\nbought by a user in your organization. You can take over a purchase or trial subscription, and\\nthen assign or unassign licenses.\\nTo see which subscriptions your organization has, follow these steps.\\n1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center.\\n2. In the navigation menu, select Billing > Your products.\\nYour active Fabric and Power BI subscriptions are listed along with any other subscriptions you\\nhave.\\nAdmins can assign and manage Fabric admin roles. Admin roles allow users to buy licenses,\\nand control organizational settings. For example, admins with certain roles can access the\\nadmin center and manage their organization's tenant settings.\\nFabric is composed of tenants, capacities, and workspaces. Your organization might have one\\nor more tenants, each with at least one capacity. Workspaces reside in capacities, and are\\nwhere data is created, transformed, and consumed. Each organization can organize its tenants,\\ncapacities, and workspaces in accordance with their organizational structure. For example, in an\\norganization with one tenant, capacities can be organized according to the organizational\\nfunctions, and workspaces can be created according to each function's divisions.\\nTurn off self-service\\nTake over a subscription\\nView your subscriptions\\nAssign admin roles\\nCustomize a Fabric tenant\"),\n",

For example, being an admin\\nallows you to create and delete workspaces, and to control workspace settings such as Azure\\nconnections, Git integration and OneLake.\\nTo distribute management across the organization, you can also use domains. With a domain,\\nyou create a logical grouping of workspaces. For example, your organization can create\\ndomains according to functions such as sales and marketing. Designated users can become\\nadmins and oversee Fabric functions related to the data in each domain. Using domains allows\\nyour organization to appoint the right admins at the right level. You no longer need Fabric\\nadministrators with lots of permissions and responsibilities to manage every single area in your\\norganization. Using domains, you can allocate some admin rights to users who are closer to\\nthe domain's subject matter. By doing that, you free Fabric administrators to concentrate on\\norganizational processes, and allow experts to directly manage data in their fields.\\nAdmins can manage Fabric users by using the Microsoft 365 admin center.

As an admin, by deciding where your tenants and\\ncapacities are created, you can specify your organization's data storage location.\\nYou can also control your organization's disaster recovery capacity setting to make sure your\\ndata is safe if a disaster happens.\\nAdmins have control over Fabric settings and permissions across the platform.

Delegating settings\\nallows your organization to have several admins with different levels of admin rights in multiple\\nlogical locations within your organization. For example, you can have three admins with access\\nto all the settings in your organization, and another admin for each team in your organization.\\nThe team admin can control settings and permissions relevant for the team, at the capacity,\\nworkspace, or domain level, depending on the way your organization is set up. You can also\\nhave multiple levels of admins in your organization, depending on your organization's needs.\\nAdmins can enable and disable global platform settings by controlling the Tenant settings. If\\nyour organization has one tenant, you can enable and disable settings for the entire\\norganization from that tenant. Organizations with multiple tenants require an admin for each\\ntenant. If your organization has several tenants, it can opt for a centralized approach by\\nappointing one admin (or a team of admins) to control the settings for all the organization's\\ntenants.\\nCapacity and workspace settings allow you to be more specific when you control your Fabric\\nplatform, because they apply to a specific capacity or workspace. Most Fabric experiences and\\nfeatures, have their own settings, allowing control at an experience or feature level. For\\nexample, workspace administrators can customize Spark compute configuration settings.\\nIn Fabric, workspace roles allow workspace admins to manage who can access data. Some of\\nthe things workspace roles determine, are which users can view, create, share, and delete Fabric\\nitems. As an admin, you can grant and revoke workspace roles, using them to control access to\\ndata in your organization. You can also create security groups and use them to control\\nworkspace access.\\nAn important part of an admin's role is to monitor what's going on in the organization. Fabric\\nhas several tools for monitoring different aspects of the platform usage. Monitoring enables\\nyour organization to comply with internal policies and external rules and regulations.

Delegation allows the organization to\\ngive admins control over specific settings relevant to their area of responsibility.\\nDelegation prevents centralized admins from becoming a bottle neck for teams across\\nthe organization that require control over specific settings.\\nHere are some key concepts related to delegating settings in Fabric:\\nTenant Settings - Global settings controlled by tenant administrators that impact\\nthe entire tenant.\\nDomain - A logical grouping of workspaces aimed at facilitating data mesh\\narchitecture.\\nCapacity - A dedicated compute resource. Capacity admins can delegate settings\\nconcerning the performance and consumption of compute resources.\\nWorkspace - Collaborative environments where Fabric items are stored and shared.\\nCertain tenant settings can be delegated to workspaces through a domain or a\\ncapacity.\\nDomain, capacity and workspace admins can override tenant settings. Overriding tenant\\nsettings allows admins to modify their environment to meet specific requirements.\\nWhen a setting is adjusted in a domain or capacity, it affects only the workspaces linked\\nto those administrative units. Similarly, changes to a workspace impact only the items\\nstored within that workspace.\\nA setting can be delegated either through domains or capacities, but not both. This\\nensures clarity in governance and prevents conflicts in the management of settings.\\nAfter delegating to a domain or capacity, certain settings can be further delegated to\\nworkspaces.
